# Still a WIP, ACTIVELY WORKING ON IT.
# Next task: fix README.

(Before we start, you should also check out [TODO](./TODO.md))

(I've come to a conclusion that one README.md is not enough to explain how this program works. Check wiki.)

Welcome to node-pogo-scanspawn-cdlm.

### Objective

Scans for spawns that Niantic enabled.

### Background

Spawn points are all level 20 cells. Niantic could enable and disable spawn points. This is why there are spawn point changes.

This application attemps to scan all the spawn points at a given location / a given area.

### Requirements

- `node >= 6.0.0`

### Configuration

See wiki.Configuration.

### Usage

#### `scanSpawn.js`

`node scanSpawn.js` or `npm start`.

This starts the main program
